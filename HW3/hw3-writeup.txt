It is my first time using a cloud-hosted DBMS like SQL Server in Microsoft's data, so I am still trying to get used to it.
Without a doubt, I recommend it! Cloud-hosted DBMS is perfect for tinkering and learning due to its ease of use, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. It allows students to focus on practicing SQL and database concepts without getting bogged down by hardware management. For instance, there is no need to install or manage hardware, allowing for immediate experimentation. For students and smaller teams, the ease of use, scalability, and collaboration features make it a powerful tool for experimentation and rapid development.
